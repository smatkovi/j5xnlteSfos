# j5xnlteSfos
i provide the manifest and the fixup-mountpoints script for other porters to take a chance at porting sailfish os to the samsung galaxy j5 2016
i also decided to add the defconfig i used for the kernel that you don't have to search for the dependencies of the kernel options in the last section there are commented out options that could be enabled and probably also miss some dependencies. i couldn't get to boot it only telnet or ssh were possible for me. maybe someone has better luck or skill.
